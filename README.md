## This is a simple timer.
1. Select button(1h/2h/3h) and Start.   
2. After times done, short animation will play.   
3. Follow that, and just take a rest for your health. Sometimes We focus so hard, we forgot a rest.   

## What I used for this project?
* HTML/CSS/JS.   
* Neumorphism design.   
* Responsive web.   

## To be added or modified.
- [ ] button:focus { outline: 0; }   
- [ ] details about respoinsive web.(when I used this at iPad Pro, "countdown-view" is not displayed in the center of the screen.)   
- [ ] more animations.
