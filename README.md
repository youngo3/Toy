## This is a simple timer.
1. Select button(1h/2h/3h) and Start.   
2. After times done, short video will auto play.   
3. Follow that, and just take a rest for your health. Sometimes We focus so hard, we forgot a rest.   

## What I used for this project?
* HTML/CSS/JS.   
* Neumorphism design.     

## To be added or modified.
